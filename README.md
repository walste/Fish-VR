OS: Linux, Ubuntu 12.04

A virtual reality assay for larval zebrafish including code for Optokinetic and Optomotive reflex, and a classical conditioning assay with a visual conditioned stimulus.

Additional equipment: 
---------------------
Beamer (Optoma), Camera (Point Grey Research), Infrared illumination /w filter, laser (Roithner), Arduino Mega board. 

Additinal software: 
-------------------
ROS for creating the visual stimulus, Motmot (Straw, A.D. and Dickinson, M.H. (2009) 
) for communicating with the camera, Arduino software /w pyFirmata for communicating with the laser

Stimulus:
---------

A bar grating (red or white with black) which is moving in the OKR and OMR assay and standing in the classical conditioning assay. 
The unconditioned stimulus in the classical conditioning assay is a laser. 

Set-up:
-------
The larval zebrafish (6-10dpf) are immobilized in low melting point agarose (2%) in a lid of a 35 mm petri dish and the agarose around tail and head and in the fish's field of view is removed with a scalpel. A projection screen is attached to the rim of the petri dish and the dish is mounted on a stage. The visual stimulus is projected from the front at a distance of about 35 cm while the fish is being filmed from below using a mirror. An ifrared LED illuminates the fish from the side.
